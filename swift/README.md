### 1) Create a sample project for swift application with one test case.
### 2) Make sure use swift base image with version.
### 3) Create a Dockerfile to serve the project.
### 4) Create docker-compose to setup the local environment.

## Note:
* Container name must be swift-con.
* Image name must be swift-img.
* Please do not use third party images for serve the project.
* You can use multistage dockerfile for serve the project.
* The build layers of the images must be less.


## Best Practices for Dockerfile and docker-compose.
* Use volume in docker-compose for runtime changes.
* Include comments on every step in Dockerfile and docker-compose file.
* Please include maintainer in Dockerfile.
